### Demo

### Motivation
I use [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) to browse and play movies I've ripped from my DVDs and Blu-Rays for convenience. Plex pulls metadata from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org), which is a great source but can be hit-or-miss for cover art. iTunes artwork is official, and is almost always high quality. When I'm not satisfied with TMDb's offerings, this app allows me to quickly grab a better option for my library.

This was also a fun exercise in macOS development, since most of my experience is with mobile platforms.
